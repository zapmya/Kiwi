Download and extract current version e.g. into $HOME/LLVM. Create two folders aside the source folder to hold
the build and install files. Your folder structure should look something like this

    llvm-3.4-build
    llvm-3.4-install
    llvm-3.4-src

Enter the build folder and type

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/gru/LLVM/llvm-3.4-install/ /home/gru/LLVM/llvm-3.4-src/
    make -j8
    make install

Troubleshooting

    When doing a debug build (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release=Debug) then during the linking stage LLVM needs lots of memory.
    You will need 8GB of ram when running one build thread (=make -j1) and you will also need about 40GB(!) of disk
    storage during compilation and installation of LLVM.
